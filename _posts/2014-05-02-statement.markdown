Much of the unrest that lies in the world is due to one's lack of connection to one's self. Furthermore, the paradox of humankind is that within the one lies the manifold of the many, and thus it is so that self and other are inexplicably intertwined. It is here, at this junction, which lies between, above, below, enfolding both and yet nothing, where the one can transcend itself, become the many, and at the same moment, become a God.

The greatest illusion and tragedy that has befallen us, the children of flesh, is that through the creation of forms, we have become slaves to the conventions that place distinctions between us. For in the abyss, the primordial bubble from which all life arises, there is no distinction. There is no separation. There is only the one.

Thus it must be, for one to maintain one's sense of wonder with life, that ever flowing stream which waits for nothing, one must render the veil that separates us asunder and look down into the deep, the infinite. And one will see that the infinite is your own reflection.

From the moment the gaze rests on this reflection, and the illusion of forms, the illusion of separation is pierced, how can one do anything other than love? Selfishness is the greatest of all selflessness. Here is the source for all joy.

Love your brother, your father, your mother, your sister, for they are yourself.
Love the sky, the moon, and stars, for your bones are made from their final breaths.
Love the river, the ocean, for its undulating waves are the same as those you find in a lover's embrace.
Love the dirt beneath your feet, for it is the womb from which all life springs.

And where love prospers, all actions which are loving can spring. We learn not to destroy the gifts of the earth, for if we do, we are destroying ourselves. We learn not to cause pain for all creatures, because in doing so, we cause pain to ourselves. We discard the concept of hate, for to hate another is the same as to hate ourselves.

Life is a river, in which the blood between all creatures flow between. The Chinese believe that all life is connected through a single red thread.

In the modern age, the concept of ritual has been outmoded. And yet the ritual is the body for which the truths of life, which by their nature escape practice, are given shape through EXPERIENCE. The method of ritual is allegory, and through them, one not only learns of these truths, but lets them take root in the center of their being.

Zrcadlo aims, through the intersection of modern mediums of technology, design and art, to recreate the experience of ancient rituals, to guide disparate, wayward, weary souls towards the root of all existence.
